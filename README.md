## Hello, I'm Claudia! 👋

## 🌍 About Me
  I am passionate about the IT field, with a particular interest in frontend development. I consider myself a creative and innovative individual, and I also appreciate backend development for its problem-solving and scalability challenges. I am about to start my first year in the e-Business master's program at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics, and Economic Informatics at the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the same faculty, specializing in Economic Informatics.
